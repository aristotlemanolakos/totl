#üìù Totl is a quick script that makes basic website templates

## About
Totl isn't revolutionary and similar dev tools probably already exist (they do). I wanted a faster way to start projects and make the folders and the HTML, CSS, & JS files that went along with it. Totl is a simple tool that simplifies that process. 

## Install

Download Totl to your script folder.

`$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aristotlemanolakos/totl/master/totl.sh`

Update `.bash_profile` with `totl` alias.

`$ cd ~/ && nano .bash_profile`

Add 

`alias totl='bash ~/[PATH_TO_SCRIPT_FOLDER]/totl.sh'`
