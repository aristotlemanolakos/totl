#üìù Totl is a quick script that makes basic website templates

## About
Totl isn't revolutionary and similar dev tools probably already exist (they do). I wanted a faster way to start projects and make the folders and the HTML, CSS, & JS files that went along with it. Totl is a simple tool that simplifies that process. 

## Install

Download Totl to your script folder.

`$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aristotlemanolakos/totl/master/totl.sh`

If a new directory is made, make sure to include path. 

`$ export PATH=$PATH:`

`alias totl='bash  ~/scripts/totl.sh'`

*Let me figure out how to shell script a little better and I'll be back later...*
